Data classification on the Iris dataset in Python was conducted using two classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines. The Iris dataset consists of 150 instances, each representing an iris flower, with sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and three distinct species (classes) of iris flowers. The process of data classification involved the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The Iris dataset was loaded into a Python environment using Pandas. Any missing values were handled, and the categorical class labels (iris species) were encoded into numerical values for model compatibility.

Data Splitting: The dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) to train and evaluate the classification models.

Algorithm Selection: Two classification algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines, were chosen for classification. These algorithms are popular for their effectiveness in handling classification tasks.

Model Training: The selected classification algorithms were trained on the training set. During training, the models learned to recognize patterns and relationships in the data that could be used to classify iris flowers into their respective species.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each classifier was assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on the test set. These metrics provided insights into how well each model performed in terms of correctly classifying iris flowers.

Comparison of Algorithms: The performance of the KNN and SVM classifiers, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Both classifiers demonstrated strong performance, with SVM achieving a slightly higher accuracy.

In conclusion, both KNN and SVM are effective for classifying iris flowers based on their characteristics. The choice between these classifiers depends on factors such as dataset size, computational resources, and accuracy requirements.Data classification on th
